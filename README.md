# Everlend-Loan-Analysis
In the realm of financial services, EverLend stands out as a data-driven powerhouse. Leveraging an extensive repository of loan records, I delve into the exploration of Everlend's borrowers’ experiences. Each data point narrates a unique story—a tale of financial decisions, creditworthiness, loan dynamics, credit scores, financial missteps and duality of repayment.

### Goal:
The aim for this analysis is to discover insights that empower informed lending decisions and enhance EverLend's lending strategies.

### Data:
EverLend uses a huge database of loan records. Each piece of data in this collection tells a story about borrowers and their financial choices. Whether it’s credit scores or loan specifics, all this information helps us understand how lending works.

### Conclusion:
The analysis of the loan data reveals that meeting the underwriting criteria is a key factor in determining the financial outcomes of the borrowers. Those who meet the criteria have better credit scores, get lower interest rates, and possess a higher chances of paying back their loans on time. They also tend to borrow for debt consolidation, which may indicate a more responsible use of credit. They also tend to pay back loans collected for credit card purposes than others. 
On the other hand, those who do not meet the criteria face higher interest rates, lower credit scores, and higher delinquency rates. They also tend to borrow for debt consolidation purposes, while they are more likely to pay back loan collected for major purchases on time than any other loan.

### Recommendation:
Based on the findings, it is recommended that the Everlend should:
Continue to apply the underwriting criteria rigorously, as it helps to identify the most creditworthy and reliable borrowers.
Offer incentives or rewards to the borrowers who meet the criteria, such as lower fees, flexible repayment options, or loyalty programs, to encourage them to maintain their good financial habits and retain their loyalty.
Be cautious with lending to borrowers for small business purposes as they have the least repayment rate, especially borrowers who do not meet the underwriting criteria.
